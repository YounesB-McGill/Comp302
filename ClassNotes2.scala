    In A2, we did eval: ASTNode, env → String
    
    But if we want to do recursion, we need to be careful!
    
    How do we return an perhaps anonymous function?
    We need to do both return a String, or an actual function
    
    "{{  {'||foo'} }}" // invocation of an anonymous function definition. nArgs not relevant here
    INNERITEXT + DEFINE → return nothing, so function name is two spaces, but wait!
    We trim whitespace and end up w "".
    So let's create a binding from name to body.
    But we could have many anon fucntions!
    
    So let's return TWO things instead: eval(node, envr) → returns (String or function)
    
    How to choose? Can't know in advance, so we will always return a pair String, function)
    
    Our lang is dynamically typed like Python. We don't know the explicit type of things
    
    "{{  {'||foo'}{'||bar'} }}"
    INNERITEXT + DEFINE + DEFINE
    
    We could have chose to make this an error, but we choose to take the last definition we found.
    
    
    "{{  x  {'y||foo'}|{{y}} }}" // space space x space space
    
    Definition of x includes y||foo. We'll allow this as "  x  " + "", ie we treat {'y||foo'} as "", and we bind y to "",
    so {{y}} is foo.

  def foo{
  }
  
  
}
